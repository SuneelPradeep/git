# React + Vite

- This repository contains code that has the functionality of GIT repo search and sort made using ReactJS, ANTDesign, Axios, and GitHub API
- you can have a look here at the deployed site https://gitreposearchsort.netlify.app/
- 
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
